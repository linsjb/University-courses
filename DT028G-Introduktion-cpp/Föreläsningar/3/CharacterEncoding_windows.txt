Swedish characters aren't displayed properly 
when using DOS and Visual Studio (2013):
to solve this:
open DOS and type: chcp 1252
//1252 is the same encoding to be used when saving the 
textfile with Swedish characters to be read.
//It is also the same encoding used in Visual Studio as default.

remember that this encoding is just one alternative
there can be and are other encodings you can use. UTF-8 is maybe the best choice, you need to test.
To change encoding for visual Studio, click on the cpp
sourcefile (activate the window)-->click on FILE-->
Advanced save options and choose different encoding
for testing. 
Remember: SoruceFile, DOS and windows encoding must match.
