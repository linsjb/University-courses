\subsection{Vehicle-to-infrastructure} \label{v2iSec}
The vehicle-to-infrastructure, or V2I, is a communication model that is used for data sharing between vehicle and infrastructure such as road signs, traffic lights and traffic cameras. The communication is bi-directional which means that the infrastructure could both receive and transmitt information between the vehicles.

A useful scenario with this model could be to inform surrounding vehicles that a serious accident has happend in front. The drivers and/or the vehicles could then take action to adopt their speed and be prepared for the upcoming accident. 
The model could also be used to send information about the accident to a Traffic Management Center (TMC) so the workers could take action and help in all possible ways. \cite{v2xPaper}
