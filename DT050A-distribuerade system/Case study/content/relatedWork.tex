\section{Related research}
In this case study two research papers has been explored.

\subsection{Adaptive traffic signal control}
in the paper \textit{Vehicle-to-infrastructure communication-based adaptive traffic signal control} \cite{vicacPaper} they explore how the online travel time estimation could be better and more precisely. This is done by building a traffic control system that, with the help och V2I communication, controls the traffis lights in an intersection. In this way, the red light time can be optimized on how many cars the different lines in the intersection have.\cite{vicacPaper}

\bigskip

They benchmark their system again two real traffic light systems. Optimized fixed-time and basis policy. The optimized fixed-time has it's red and green light time preset. This means that it could not be dynamically changed. The other system, basis policy, is using two different control policies to control the red and green light in the intersection.\cite{vicacPaper}

\bigskip

The result of the research shows that the VICAC system saves 11\% of the total travel time in the Fixed-time system and 9\% in the basis policy.\cite{vicacPaper}

\subsection{V2X traffic management}
the paper \textit{V2X traffic management} \cite{v2xPaper} is more like a information paper that explain how the V2X can be used in traffic management. In this case study information has been gathered from this paper.
