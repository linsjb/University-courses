\section{Outgoing client}
The same concept is designed when a client is leaving the chat. Firstly the outgoing client will send a broadcast to every client that will send a broadcast to every other connected clients. A method named \textit{onClientDisconnectBroadcast} is taking care of the deletion of the outgoing client. The client window data will first get flushed then insert to the updated array again. \cref{code:cdb} is showing this method.

\begin{listing}

\label{code:cdb}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, breaklines]{java}
public void onClientDisconnectBroadcast(ClientDisconnectBroadcast cdb) {
    clientsWindow.setText("");

    clients.remove(cdb.client);

    for (int i = 0; i < clients.size(); i++) {
        clientsWindow.setText(clientsWindow.getText() + "\n" + clients.get(i));
    }

}
\end{minted}
