\section{Vector clock}
The vector clock for this second lab is of the type HashMap. The HashMap is provided with a key as a String and a value as a Integer.
The key is the random username that gets generated when a new client is created and the value is the value of the local clock.

\subsection{Initalization}
Every user has their own clock that is initalized with the username and the value set to zero when the user is created (in the constructor). As  \cref{code:usrCtor} below shows.
In this way it's easy to keep track of which clock to change when a message is sent.

\label{code:usrCtor}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines]{java}
public User() {
    this.vectorClock = new VectorClock();
    vectorClock.put(this.username, 0);
}
\end{minted}
