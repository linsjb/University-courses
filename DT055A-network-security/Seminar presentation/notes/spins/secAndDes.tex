The next step is the security design and requirements.

\alert{Security}

 Since the computation resouces is strictly limited an assymetric cryptographic approach is to expensive to use. Instead symmetric cryptographic primitives is used to construct the  SPINS protocol.

\bigskip


Due to the limited program store in the node all cryptographic primitives is constructed out of a singel block cipher. And to reduce communication overhead a common state is utilized between the communication parties.

\alert{Requirements}

When we talk about security requirements the sensors should never, under any circiumstances, leek information to any close by networks. Therfore data authentication is important so the receiving side know who the information comes from. The receiver also need to obtain fresh data at all time.
