Snep provides a number of advantages. it has a low communication overhead because it only adds 8 bytes per message. It used a counter but this is not transmitted. Instead both end points , that is the sender and receiver, supervising the state of their own counter. it provides even semantic security which is a really strong security property that prevents eavesdropping on messages.

SNEP also has semantic security which ensure that a eavedroppes has no information about the plaintext at all. This semantic security is done with randomization which is not energy efficient. The team solves this by constructing a semantig security mechanism that does not add any transmission overhead. They rely on the shared counter between the sender and receiver. But as you might remember the counter is not transmittet. Instead the counter is incremented after each block.

They use a message authenticaton code (MAC) to enable two-party authentication.

The combination of these mentiones mechanisms form the Sensor Network Encryption protocol, SNEP
