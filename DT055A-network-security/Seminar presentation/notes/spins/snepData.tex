Lets talk about the data encryption step.

The encrypted data has the format in equation 1.
Where the D is the data, $K_{encr}$ is the encryption key and $C$ is the counter.

The $MAC$ is calculated as equation 2.

\bigskip


The $K_{encry}$ and $K_{mac}$ is derived from a master secret key $K$.

The complete message is shown in the third equation
