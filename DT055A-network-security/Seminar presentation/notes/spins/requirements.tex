The team also set up a requirements for their prototype. A will quote directly from the paper "our goal is to design the SPINS key setup so a compromise of a node does not spread to other nodes". The foundation in this is that basic wireless communication often has low security because it broadcast out information. 
This makes it easier to eavesdrop the traffic and inject new messages.

With SPINS the team makes no trust assumptions on the communication infrastructure. Since the base station is the sensor gateway and the device that communicating with the outside world it's a  neccesary part of the trusted computing base. With this approach the system is setup in a way that all sensor nodes trust the base station. At creation time each node is given a master key which is shared with the base station.

Finally each node also trust itself.
