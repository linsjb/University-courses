The team has devided their evaluation into three categories.
The first category is code size. In this step they evalute different implementations in terms of code size, RAM size and processor and communication overhead. They have tested three different crypto routines.The result is presented in the top left.

\bigskip


The second category is performance. The sensor can handle a maximum of throughput of 20 30-bytes messages every second with an processor load of 50%.

\bigskip


The third and last category is energy cost. The most of the energy cost will come from extra data transmission that the protocols requires. The scond biggest energy cost is the MAC transmission. The MAC uses 8 bytes of every 30 bytes message. It also achieves integrity so another message integrity mechanism is not needed. But encrypting and signing a message imposes an overhead of 6 bytes per message over an unenceypted message with integrity checking.
