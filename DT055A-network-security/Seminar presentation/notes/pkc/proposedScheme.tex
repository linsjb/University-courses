The team has proposed a broadcast authentication scheme for PKC. Which will

meet the properties low overhead,

strong authenticity, immediate authentication, no time synchronization

and resilience to node compromise attacks.

The scheme is using a signature amortization that exploits a ECDSA signature.

This is used to authenticate all broadcast messages. It's described and presented

in three steps. Generation extended block step, broadcasting extended block steps and verifying extended block step. 

To avoid message collision different reply times to selected.
