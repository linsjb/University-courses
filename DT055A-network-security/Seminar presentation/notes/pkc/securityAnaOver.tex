Next we will analyse the security overhead which is being analyzed according to the following steps.
Computation overhead, the average time to authenticate one broadcast message at both the sender and receiver side.

Communication overhead, the average authenticator size per broadcast message

Authentication delay, the time delay to authenticate an extended block at the receiver side, and lastly the memory overhead, which is the memory size to buffer all extended blocks at the sender side. And also the size of the memory required to authenticate one extended block
