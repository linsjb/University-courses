The result is summarized  of 20 to a 100 broadcast messages.  SA1 to SA10 are actual test results and HMAC and SIGS is used for comparison. 

The first result of the experiment is the average execution time to authenticate one broadcast message at the sender and receiver side. 

The left graph shows the average execution time to authenticate a one broadcast message at the senders side and the right graph shows the receiver side. As seen the average execution time get's lower when more message is being sent.
