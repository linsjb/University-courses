The team has performed a testbed where the topology can be seen here.

Each sensor node store the address of its neighbor. When one of the connected neighbor transmit

a broadcast message it's neighbors will receive it.

The sender sends out a total of 100 broadcasts. The sending rate satisfies the poisson distribution

with an average of 0.2 messages per second, where each message has a payload of 20 bytes.

The receiver rebroadcast the messages after it has received it after a time delay of maximum 2 seconds.
