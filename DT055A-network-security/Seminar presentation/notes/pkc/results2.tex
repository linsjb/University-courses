The next result is for computation overhead, which shows the average authenticator size per broadcast message in bytes which is shown in the left graph. As shown the authentication size is smaller than both of the compared methods which is good. 

Next up is the result for cummunication overhead which is measured by the total messages versus the probability of message loss. As seen in the right graph the probability for loss increase when the number of messages increase.
