This article is presenting a novel proposed PKC based authentication scheme for WSNs, where the proposed scheme exploits one elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). This algorithm is used to authenticate all broadcast messages.

\bigskip

PKC is proposed to be used in WSNs because of the reduction in overhead that Elliptic curve Cryptography (ECC) comes with.
