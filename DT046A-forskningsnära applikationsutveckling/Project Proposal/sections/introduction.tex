\section{Introduction}
The industry we know today is about to change. With the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the \textit{Industrial 4.0} around the corner a high pressure is created on the companies developing this new industrial world. Cheap and small hardware could be a positive thing for the industry when a lot of devices is being placed around a specific industrial chain of processes.

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this research project is to investigate how well IIoT like devices which has limited performance works together with the industrial communication standard OPC-UA \cite{opcfoundation}.

% The purpose of this research project is to investigate if small cheap devices like Raspberry PI \cite{raspPi} is possible to use with the industry communication standard OPC-UA \cite{opcfoundation}. But also if they meet the requirements in performance which means low access time and fast computation of smaller tasks and data processing.
