\section{Research question} \label{researchQuestion}
The goal with this research project is to evalute how well suited OPC-UA is together with IIoT devices. \numitems{testList} research question has been formed for this project.

\begin{countlist}{testList}
    \item How fast is the access time when the OPC-UA client ask the OPC-UA server for information?
    \item Does the access time get's affected when larger and larger data is asked from the server?
\end{countlist}

% Old
%the goal of this research project is to evaluate if the usage of cheap IIoT devices is possible with the industrial communication standard OPC-UA. Two Raspberry PI's will be used to evaluate how the response time get's affected when low powered devices with a limited proessing power is used. 

\subsection{Expected result}
The expected result is that small data chunks will have a rather low access time. But when the data grows in size the access time will get affected in a negative way.
