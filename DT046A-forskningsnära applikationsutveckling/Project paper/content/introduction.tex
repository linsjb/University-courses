\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
The first industrial revolution came with the steam and water power.
The second came with electricity and assembly lines and the third one brought the automation and computer powered industrial plants to the world.
The next industrial revolution, \textit{Industrial 4.0} as it's called, is going to change the industry drastically where the controllers and computers move from a centralized solution to a decentralized one. This makes it possible to move the controllers closer to the process. \cite{industryFourDesign}

To achieve this \acrfull{iot} like devices that's specifically designed for industrial use is needed to control and read different kind of equipment such as sensors and actuators. This area is called the \acrfull{iiot}. 

\bigskip

But how well will these \acrshort{iiot} devices work together with the industrial communication standard \textit{\acrfull{opcua}}? How will the access time to both process and demand data on the server gets affected when large data loads is asked by the client? This research article will evaluate how well low performance devices work together with \acrshort{opcua}. The clients total round trip time (RTT) and server process time will be measured and compared between different systems and data sizes.
