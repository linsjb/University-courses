\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
The outcome of this research answer the initial questions if \acrshort{iiot} devices and \acrshort{opcua} can work together. As the result shows low performance \acrshort{iiot} devices can be used with the \acrshort{opcua} standard to handle the communication in industries. Those devices are best suited down at the plant floor where they're close to the processes they shall supervise and where the power and area is limited. These kind of devices can and should perform lightweight data processing and actions but let centralized servers perform the heavier data tasks.
