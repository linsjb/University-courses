\section{Results} \label{results}
The result from the load test does show how well the three different system perform. As the result shows in \cref{fig:loadTestClientRtt} the \acrshort{rpi} 1 has the longest total round trip time at the client compared with \acrshort{rpi} 3 and reference system. This is in line with the performance of the systems since the \acrshort{rpi} one is the weakest of the three and therefore gives the longest RTT.

To extend the result further a comparison between the servers process time the number and sort operations is presented in \cref{fig:loadTestServer}. This clearly shows that the number generation operations takes up approximated 90\% of the total server process time.
