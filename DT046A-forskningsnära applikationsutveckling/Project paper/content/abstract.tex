    With Industry 4.0 and IIoT getting closer to realization the demand of IIoT devices that has a good ratio between performance and cost is welcoming for the whole industry. But those devices also need to work well together with the OPC-UA standard. This research will explore if and how low-performing and low-cost devices and the OPC-UA work together in a suitable way. Measurements has been made regarding the access time when a OPC-UA client ask a OPC-UA server to perform and handle large data sets. These results has been compared against a reference systems to show how well the devices work in these kind of tests. The results shows that low-powered devices can perform lightweight data processing but should hand over the heavier tasks to centralized units.
