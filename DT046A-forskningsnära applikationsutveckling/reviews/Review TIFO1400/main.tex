\section{Introduction} \label{}
Not much to complain about in the introduction. Well explained and a good balance in the details. 
Have one comment tho. The second sentence in the second paragraph feels a bit long. At least in my brain it becomes a little messy. Maybe split it up in two sentenced after the comma?

\section{Overall} \label{}
Not really that much to comment about your article so far.
The title is good and compact which is a nice thing.

\bigskip

A more complete draft with test results etc. wouldn't hurt. It would have been easier to give any type of constructive criticism which is hard at this point.

\bigskip

It would have been nice (even if it's just a first and early draft) to remove all the placeholders form the template. But since the length of the article was just over two and a half page its okay.
