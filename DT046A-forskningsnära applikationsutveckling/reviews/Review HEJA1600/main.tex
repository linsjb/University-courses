\section{Overall} \label{}
I can't find anything wrong with the title of your work.

Well written article. What i can found and read everything is nicely linked together with no ambiguities. This makes it really easy to follow the whole work. From the introduction to the background to the experiment etc.

\section{Template} \label{}
the template doesn't look like the official IEEE article template tho.

\section{Experiment} \label{}
Only problem i could found here is a small typo. In the last sentence of the \textbf{Experiment} section you have two \textit{the}.

\subsection{Test parameters} \label{}
Just to make the numbers in \textbf{Test parameters} easier to read i think it's smart to insert thousand separators into them.

\section{Result graphs} \label{}
The text in the graphs i rather small. It wouldn't hurt to enlarge the text.
