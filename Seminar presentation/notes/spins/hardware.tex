The sensor the team is using in their prototype is based on sensors from the SmartDust system. This system include robotics, sensors and other devices that can detect various things. Those sensors forms a self organized wireless network.

The parts in this prototype is nodes which is small battery powered devices. These are communicating with a bast station which has a higher performance than the nodes. The base station is the bridge between the WSN and the real network.

In the table in the right bottom corner we can see the performance of those devices. As shown in this table they are not directly super powerful.
