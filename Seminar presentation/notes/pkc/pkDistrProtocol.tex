If we look at the proposed scheme for the public key distribution protocol it should introduce a low overhead for the sensors that has constrained resources. The sensors are preloaded with the base stations public key. The scheme is implemented in a three step way:

First the sender send a request  to the base station and ask for a certifiate. Secondly the base station replies with a new certificate for the sender. which is being signed with the base stations private key. And lastly the sender can broadcast to all receivers in the network.
